I modified it with a friend, made it faster, and added a solar trailer to extend its range. I even got a compliment from an engineer who works for Tesla. How impressed they were with my solar trailer. Cool EH?"

What they have done in their cars adding solar panels integrated into their structure is far more sexy than my solar trailer although my solar trailer could always hold true tremendous amount of weight in the frame of the panel weighed more than the whole trailer."

Never buy any German product.. I take that back there are some German products that are good but mostly there over engineered and poor quality or so I have seen so far now you can’t compare that with the BMW and the Mercedes and the Volkswagen and even the Skoda which are excellent vehicles made by Germans however many other things in my my experience has been with German companies is that they are not entirely honest.
