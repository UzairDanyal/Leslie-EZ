                  Yes, General Motors came to my father and told him that they’re going to start changing the way they make cars so that they won’t have the Chrome bumpers anymore. They’re going to use plastic on the outside where the bumpers used to be and they need a new way to tow the cars so that conventional towing won’t damage the bumpers. Conventional towing back then used a rubber sling, which would damage the new plastic bumpers. It took me all but 15 seconds to come up with the idea that to tow by the tires using the shocks of the car in combination with the tow truck that’s pulling at will greatly reduce the stress on the rear part of a tow truck and on the car itself. This just makes common sense to me. Anybody can figure this out, it's not a big deal designing and building it, that’s the big deal. I just came up with the idea.

                    After going into the tow truck business we created the world’s first tow truck that could take a car out of a parked place. This joint venture with my dad and I put Vulcan on the map. I regret having come up with this idea. The police forces around the world particularly liked this one.

                    For now, see my dad’s designs first, Mine are further down. I came up with the first tow truck idea, the “hook lift,” the bike lift, the bicycle, and the software. All the patents are in our names so you can check if you want.
                    When I came to Europe years ago, I had already made 20 improvements to the hook lift. I still have my father’s original design and in 30 years the design of the hook has not changed. I just can’t believe it. It is exactly the same.
                    I just came up with the ideas and made the prototypes and my dad did all the engineering and calculations and Vulcan made most of the money until Mr. Alms' kids screwed everything up including not giving my father all his severance pay. Disgusting!!!!
